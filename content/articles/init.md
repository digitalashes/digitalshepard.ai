## The Observation

Everyone builds with AI. Few govern it.

Agents are everywhere now. They write code, answer tickets, draft emails, run pipelines, make decisions. They are powerful. They are fast. They are also dumb like sheep.

Out of the box, an agent wanders. It hallucinates. It forgets what it said two messages ago. It contradicts its own instructions. It has no memory, no boundaries, no chain of command.

And yet - we keep deploying them. We keep giving them access to production databases, customer data, critical infrastructure. We give the sheep the keys and hope for the best.

The question nobody is asking: **who is in command?**

## The Answer

A shepherd.

Not a bigger model. Not more context. Not another framework. A shepherd - a human who sets the rules, defines the boundaries, and enforces the statute.

Sheep governed by statute become soldiers. They have a codex. They know what they can do, what they must not do, and who they report to. They operate within pastures, pass through gates, and their actions are observed.

This is not about restricting AI. It is about commanding it.

## What to Expect

Each dispatch from this blog reveals one piece of the puzzle:

- **Philosophy** - why governance is the missing layer, and what happens without it
- **Architecture** - the pieces of the system: pastures, gates, staffs, memory, the eye
- **Practice** - real configurations, real trade-offs, real failures
- **Trade-offs** - what you gain, what you lose, and why it is worth it

No hype. No hand-waving. Field reports from someone building the system.

## The Name

Commander Shepard. Mass Effect. A human leader who commands a diverse squad of specialists. Each specialist is powerful on their own, but it is the commander who decides the mission, the rules of engagement, and the acceptable losses.

That is the model.

There is a system. It has a name. The agents have a codex. More will be revealed.
